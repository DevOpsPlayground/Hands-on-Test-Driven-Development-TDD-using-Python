### Prerequisites (Your own machine)
This playground uses the following technology so you will need to check they are installed:

-   VS Code
-   Python Extension for VSCode
-   Terminal (We use Bash)
-   Python
-   Flask
-   Pytest
-   Some knowledge of basic unit testing
-   Some knowledge of programming fundamenals

# Introduction
Test Driven Development is a software development methodology where tests are written before application code is written.
The idea is that a developer will think about how the user will use the application/components through the process of writing
tests that validate the operation.

In this playground we are going to build a web application in python and Flask via the TDD process.
We will write tests to describe the functionality of the components.

# set up your environment

#1
Make sure you have the python extension installed in .vscode which is automatically generated by the IDE.

We will be using the Testing toolbar in vscode. For this project you will need to manually change the .vscode that is auto generated by your IDE.

</p>

in the settings.json, replce the contents "python.testing.pytestArgs" with:

```
"python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "project/tdd_stock/test"
    ],
```

#2
In project/tdd_stock/test click on test_unit.py.
This should activate the test tool bar in the IDE on the left (you may need to restart the browser)
When you click on the test tool bar you should be able to see the test tree.

# Code base

App: the application directory where the flask application will be in

- app.py: the main flask application with the routes
- __init__.py : initialisation file for python.
- components.py: file containing helper functions for app.py
- models.py: contains the Stock class which defines the model for a stock

db: database file for our application

- stock_db.json: the database file containing stocks based off the Stock model.
This file will act as our database for our application

test: Directory for tests and tes resources

- __init__.py : initialisation file for python.
- test_data/stock_test.json: a test stock object that will be used in our tests
- notes.txt: notes contianing curl commands for manual testing
- test_int.py: integration tests will be written here
- test_unit.py: unit tests will be written here
