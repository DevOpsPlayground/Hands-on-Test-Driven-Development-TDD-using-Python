# Introduction
Test Driven Development is a software development methodology where tests are written before application code is written.
The idea is that a developer will think about how the user will use the application/components through the process of writing
tests that validate the operation.

In this playground we are going to build a web application in python and Flask via the TDD process.
We will write tests to describe the functionality of the components.
